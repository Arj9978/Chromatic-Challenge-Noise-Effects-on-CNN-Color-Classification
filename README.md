## Introduction

Welcome to the Chromatic Challenge repository! This project aims to explore the intriguing world of color classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in the presence of various noise types and levels. Colors play a pivotal role in image recognition and understanding how noise impacts CNN-based color classification models can provide valuable insights into their robustness and reliability.

## Motivation

With the increasing reliance on computer vision systems in real-world applications, understanding the vulnerabilities of these systems is crucial. Noise, in the form of sensor inaccuracies, compression artifacts, and environmental factors, is an inevitable aspect of image data. This project delves into the impact of noise on CNN models trained for color classification tasks.
